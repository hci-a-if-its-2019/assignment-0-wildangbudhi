### 1.1 Bad Things
- **Authentication** <br />
  We have to enter the password and username many times after scanning the QR CODE, Face Scan, Signature, Predict, Upload, etc
- **Useless object & Different Titles** <br />
	In this application there are many objects that do not have any use in this application, so when clicked do not run anything such as email or main icon. And some page having Different Title from the content such as Signatur Training page which have "Training Image" as title. And so on.
- **Bad Training Image and Training Signature Service**
	This application really cannot Train Image or Signature when there are Multiple User train image or signature in the same time. And not we have to Train image or Signature manualy <br >

### 1.2 Sugestion
- Make the Authentification only done once, if you want to secure the app just add the Passcode. But with out Passcode the application is pretty save with Face Recognition and Signature Recognition.
- Remove Useless object and Fix the wrong page title
- Makes the Training Service automatic after user upload they Image and Signature or makes a parallel service that can Train Multiple User Data <br>
